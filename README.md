Welcome
-------
Welcome, JsRoboKey was inspired by AutoHotKey, Qt, Cross-platform coding, and javascript (thanks nodejs for making javascript real)
Think of desktop scripting using javascript.

Example Script
---------------
A simple script might look like this:
    //run notepad, wait a little bit for it to open, then send some keystrokes
    rk.run('notepad');
    rk.sleep(700);
    rk.sendKeys('abcdefgABCDEFG1234567890!@#$%^&*()');

Need Helpers
------------
In order to make this a reality, I am going to need some passionate helpers to get this working, we need most all of the feature which AutoHotKey has, and cross-platform.
The features are so many so just start coding, shoot me an email at relipse@gmail.com and start by forking the repo. Make a few changes, fix a few bus or add a few features!


Goal
----
To get a usable desktop scripting library that works cross-platform, windows, linux, and mac.
